This is a basic program that converts a natural language text to Lean 4 terms.
We use Grammatical Framework (GF) (https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) for parsing and linearisation.
The conversion is done via Haskell.
The natural language it accepts is from a controlled natural language called SimplifiedForTheL which is a simplified version of the ForTheL language (http://nevidal.org/download/forthel.pdf).
The input is given as example blocks written in SimplifiedForTheL.
This is still a work in progress, and thus the program cannot handle all example blocks written in SimplifiedForTheL.

To run the program, use `stack run`. The input should be put in the prompt.txt file.
