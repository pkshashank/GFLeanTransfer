INPUT : 
ex. assume x is a rational number . assume x is equal to ( 2 * 2 ) . then x is greater than 3 .
OUTPUT :
The sentence is - ex. assume x is a rational number . assume x is equal to ( 2 * 2 ) . then x is greater than 3 .
added variable names - ex. assume x is a rational number ( x 6 ) . assume x is equal to ( 2 * 2 ) . then x is greater than 3 .
simplified - ex. assume x is a rational number x . assume x is equal to ( 2 * 2 ) . then x is greater than 3 .
translated - example ( x : ℚ ) ( h? : x = ( 2 * 2 ) ) : x > 3 := sorry

INPUT:
ex. every odd integer greater than 2 is greater than 3 . 
OUTPUT:
The sentence is - ex. every odd integer greater than 2 is greater than 3 . 
added variable names - ex. then every odd integer ( x 6 ) greater than 2 is greater than 3 .
simplified - ex. then for every integer ( x 6 ) such that ( x 6 ) is odd and ( x 6 ) is greater than 2 , ( x 6 ) is greater than 3 .
translated - example : ∀ ( ( x 6 ) : ℤ ), ( ( odd ( x 6 ) ∧ ( x 6 ) > 2 ) → ( x 6 ) > 3 ) := sorry


INPUT:
ex. assume y is an integer . assume for no even integer x , x is odd . then y is not odd . 
OUTPUT:
The sentence is - ex. assume y is an integer . assume for no even integer x , x is odd . then y is not odd .  
added variable names - ex. assume y is a integer ( x 6 ) . assume for no even integer x , x is odd . then y is not odd .
simplified - ex. assume y is a integer y . assume for no integer x such that x is even , x is odd . then y is not odd .
translated - example ( y : ℤ ) ( h? : ∀ ( x : ℤ ), ( even x → ( ¬ odd x ) ) ) : ( ¬ odd y ) := sorry

INPUT:
ex. assume x is a real number . assume ( 2 + 2 ) is less than ( -1 ^ 3 ) . then no nonnegative integer a such that a is positive is not even .
OUTPUT:
The sentence is - ex. assume x is a real number . assume ( 2 + 2 ) is less than ( -1 ^ 3 ) . then no nonnegative integer a such that a is positive is not even . 
added variable names - ex. assume x is a real number ( x 6 ) . assume ( 2 + 2 ) is less than ( -1 ^ 3 ) . then no nonnegative integer a such that a is positive is not even .
simplified - ex. assume x is a real number x . assume ( 2 + 2 ) is less than ( -1 ^ 3 ) . then for no integer a such that a is nonnegative and a is positive , a is not even .
translated - example ( x : ℝ ) ( h? : ( 2 + 2 ) < ( -1 ^ 3 ) ) : ∀ ( a : ℤ ), ( ( nneg a ∧ pos a ) → ( ¬ ( ¬ even a ) ) ) := sorry

INPUT:
ex. assume x is an even integer greater than 32 . then every integer greater than x is greater than 32 .
OUTPUT:
The sentence is - ex. assume x is an even integer greater than 32 . then every integer greater than x is greater than 32 . 
added variable names - ex. assume x is a even integer ( x 9 ) greater than 32 . then every integer ( x 29 ) greater than x is greater than 32 .
simplified - ex. assume x is a integer x such that x is even and x is greater than 32 . then for every integer ( x 29 ) such that ( x 29 ) is greater than x , ( x 29 ) is greater than 32 .
